# DL-Phosphoglycerylation-Prediction
In this study, we employed a convolutional neural network to predict protein phosphoglycerylation. Features were extracted from pre-trained transformer models and compared with conventional features, such as evolutionary information and physicochemical/biochemical properties. Our results indicate significant performance improvements across all feature types, with the combination of transformer-based features and the convolutional neural network being especially effective. This methodology holds potential for other protein property prediction tasks.

The python scripts of the 1DCNN classifiers (for the different features) are available in this repository. The Datasets and model weights of the 1DCNN classifiers can be accessed from this [link](https://figshare.com/projects/Load_protein-peptide_binding_PepCNN_model/176094) (caution: data size is around 7GB). To execute the scripts, please download and place all these files all together in a single folder.
